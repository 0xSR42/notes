DISCLAIMER: Just like any theory of governance, these notes are based on the
knowledge and conditions of the time when they were written. These notes may
or may not be fully applicable in other settings. The reader is advised to
think about this material, and not to blindly obey and apply it for their use
case.

### Game Theory and Governance

Open source governance systems can be broken down by adversaries.
Play chess and other games with your adversaries to build reputation or trust.
(Game Theory, [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/))

Closed source governance systems can also be broken down if you have a worthy
or notorious adversary.
([iCloud Leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak))

### Ideology and Truth

(This section lacks logical rigor.)

Axiomatic ideologies (such as feminism, liberalism or communism) aren’t
exactly ideal because they can’t be used to explain or study all the truths in
society.
(Godel, [Incompleteness Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems))

Furthermore, these ideologies are relatively new
(one or two centuries old at most) and incomplete compared to history.
Therefore, one should use individualism to one’s advantage.
Enemies of open society will use misinformation, propaganda, lies,
gas-lighting and other forms of psychological manipulation to make life hell
for others.
(Popper, [Open Society and its Enemies](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited))

Humans often lie or convey information inaccurately. Therefore, truth
discovery is an important step in real word decision-making.
([Truth discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_discovery),
[Pramana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramana),
[Truth vs Perception vs Reality](https://ed.ted.com/on/AsddeXsA))

### Psychology and Language

A large population consisting of cultures with different governance systems
which have conflicting tenets, can’t be governed by a single mind for that
person will either enforce their cognitive bias on others or suffer from
cognitive dissonance if they choose to make sense out of conflicting
information.

Cognitive biases classify mistakes in thought process, and logical fallacies
describe mistakes in logical or natural language arguments.
([Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias),
[Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy))

Verbal political dissent is needed for a democratic system to survive, but the
language and style of the same can make or break the dissenter’s case. Violent
dissent is counterproductive to development of society.

One way to model the world is to see it as a psychological machine,
where information is entering and leaving minds (and bodies) and making these
beings undertake some cause (karma) or effect (phala) to change things around
them. If you know what others are thinking, you can predict future to some
degree. Reincarnation is a future being continuing the work of a deceased one.
Law of Karma is more general than tit-for-tat and entails a Karmic cycle.
(Psychology, Gita)

Developmental psychology must be taken care of when trying to raise the next
generation of society. Children and young people are susceptible to absorbing
unhealthy information or seeking taboo knowledge, and if it happens at a large
scale then it would produce a less than admirable youth. If you seed certain
ideas in a young woman's mind, who could have been a professional, she might as
well become a sex worker. By a similar logic, a young man who could have been a
productive member of economy and society, might as well become a criminal.

### History and Social Science

To be able to govern effectively you need to understand the history,
psychology, demographics, power and governance systems of your entire
population as well as your adversaries. (British Raj)

Some theorists worth reading: Chanakya, Nicolo Machiavelli, Robert Axelrod,
George Orwell, John Nash, John von Neumann.

Humans have sometimes moved forwards in time, and sometimes backwards, and
sometimes stood still for thousands of years.
(Churchill, [Fifty Years Hence](https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/fifty-years-hence.html))

### Conflict and War

Conflict is in human nature but too much of it can destroy civilizations and
too little can stall progress. Another way to state this would be to say that
society needs to engage in conflict to move (forwards or backwards) the wheel
of time.

Conflict exists primarily in me vs you, me vs us and us vs them forms between
humans. Conflict can be physical, verbal or psychological. Other ways to
define conflict could be along the lines of gender, caste, community, race,
religion, culture or nation.

Cultures with conflicting tenets, are prone to engaging in real world conflict
with each other.

When it comes to whether to accept unjust peace or fight a just war, humans
could choose to engage in the minimal conflict that allows
for progress to be made on any given issue. Minimal conflict can be defined
as the minimal set of actions which constitute the given conflict.

This is in contrast to total war as a continuation of politics by violent
means, where the fog of war can make it hard to keep things under control.
(Clausewitz, [Vom Kriege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_War)).

To find out the minimum amount of resources needed to enact the minimal
conflict, one can start with a small amount, increase the amount
exponentially (say double them) and observe results after every iteration.
Note that if you have a really stubborn enemy then you might end up enacting a
total war.

Another way to deal with such a scenario would be to redesign society and
economy. Individuals who are prone to engaging in conflict can be moved apart
in terms of distance in the social graph, and those who trust each other can
continue to live and work closely.

One more approach could be to have people with conflicting views collect
in one place, and have a neutral party find balance in those conflicting
views. This approach comes especially handy when you have participants with
different perceptions of reality. Also, this approach is markedly different
from divide and rule, or two cats and a monkey arrangement; and therefore
needs a worthy neutral party to properly execute it.
([Chicago Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven),
[The Trial of the Chicago 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_the_Chicago_7))

### Religion and Mythology

Religion and mythology is most likely fictionalized history.

The classification of humans into Asuras and Devas in Hinduism is a useful one.
([Asura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura))

Caste system evolved in Hinduism around Maurya or Gupta dynasties,
probably because it led to lesser conflict at that time compared to
varna system that was in place before that. Mahabharata is one account in
Hinduism which had varna system in place.

Breaking caste system by switching varnas through education and training,
seems to lead to lesser conflict, as compared to breaking caste system
through (Gandharva) Vivaha.

To effectively break caste system, you need folks of all four varnas with
roughly equal proportion, amongst all castes (, community, race or religion).

A person’s caste decides their behavior to some extent, but the likely
contributing factor there is that person’s DNA, psychology and personality.

The varna system is an elegant and minimal governance system. It has one
ordinary varna (Sudra) and three specialist ones (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaisya).

Note that 3 is the minimum number of nodes needed to have a fault-tolerant
consensus driven system, in distributed systems thought process. Some examples
of faults in real world would be – node failure: key members of government
falling sick or dying, network partition: communication channels breaking down
leading to echo chambers, Byzantine failure: unreliable or cunning members in
your government or organization.

Hindu governance system has been designed to internalise the conflict.
([Slavery in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_India))

### Culture and Marriage

Cultures have historically used fear, shame and guilt to maintain control.
Isolation and Incarceration are two other ways that societies use to
maintain control.

In western thought, stable marriage is one pragmatic way to go about love
marriages at scale.
([Stable Marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem))

Marriages in Hinduism are guided by scriptures such as Manusmriti, and
disallow marriage between Sapindas.
([Sapindas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapinda))

If one prefers the Gandharva Vivaha approach over Brahma Vivaha one, then AB
and BA pairs need to be made, which balance each other out, or one might end
up with the problem of inceldom. A and B could represent race, religion,
community or caste.
([Demographics of Inceldom](https://incels.wiki/w/Demographics_of_inceldom))

Making these pairs at a finer classification such as surname (, title or
gotra) level might be going down a rabbit hole. This approach can be applied
to dating as well, but since these relationships aren’t permanent, it’s better
if the couples match karma with each other. But if that is not acceptable to
either party, then phala of the karma might get delivered differently,
depending upon how the world moves forwards in time. Some possibilities are -
public shaming, intervention through legal justice system, children facing the
phala of their parents' karma, etc.

It's also better to mix cultures and castes through sides and not centres.
Eloping with a Helen of Troy or a Samyukta of Gahadavala would lead to
more conflict.

Martial races are needed for defense of a society and country. If they do love
marriage with non-martial races, then they are mixing their DNA, and therefore
making their country easier to penetrate compared to others which don’t do the
same. ([Martial Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_race))

Sex work and pornography are some occupations in society which add to
the problem of inceldom.
([Hot Girls Wanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girls_Wanted))

Sex work and inceldom are examples of poor culture in society, enabled in
part by poor allocation of capital, and can be contained in parts of the
population by establishing the Nash Equilibrium of the same.
(Nash, [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium))

The culture of a society or a country is also impacted by the karmic footprint
of its leader. If you elect someone with a poor karmic footprint as your
leader, then copycats can use that as an opportunity to enact that karmic
footprint at a large scale and disturb culture in the given society or
country. Similar arguments can be made for economy and enterprise owners.

### Society and Design

Autocratic governments allow for more efficent governance on a homogeneous
population which trusts each other. Democracy seems better suited for a
diverse population which is prone to engaging in conflict with each other.

Large institutions and organizations absorb obeyers better than thinkers, and
dissenters usually have a hard time staying put.

Organization design plays an important role in the functioning and efficiency
of the same. Traditionally organizations have been designed as pyramids, but
families are a better design, for the former can lead to authoritarianism from
the top, and conflict with those who fall off the pyramid. Of course there are
other proven designs of organizations such as republics.

### Technology and Data

Technology enables efficient governance, but it can be misused if falls in
wrong hands. Your data is a footprint of your thought process, and if your
adversaries have access to it, they can use it to cause harm to you.

Consumer tech products, such as search and social, enable people to retrieve
information quickly and connect with each other, but malicious human behaviour
would require moderation. Also, content moderation and end-to-end encryption
are not compatible with each other.
([Content moderation for end-to-end encrypted messaging](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/content-moderation-end-end-encrypted-messaging))

### Crime and Investigation

Humans often commit vices, and have a tendency to commit crimes. Once a crime
has happened, one question to be asked is whether to seek justice or revenge.

The process of seeking justice would be to collect evidence, interrogate
suspects, and formulate a theory which a judge or jury gets to decide upon.

While interrogating suspects, good cop bad cop is a strategy proven to work.
[Good cop/bad cop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_cop/bad_cop)
