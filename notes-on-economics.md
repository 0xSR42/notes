# Notes on Economics

Socialist economies are more peaceful, as they cater to needs of more people.

Free market capitalism rewards hard work and smart work alike, but malevolent
actors can cheat to their advantage.

Real world economies are more likely to be mixed economies.

Public companies can be seen as governance models as they share many problems
with a government, such as those of economics and culture.

Startups can be seen as instruments of change in real world, by solving real
world problems.

Capital plays an important role in building or breaking culture. One can
choose to build an economy of knowledge workers, and not one of sex workers.

Economists worth reading: Adam Smith, Ray Dalio.
