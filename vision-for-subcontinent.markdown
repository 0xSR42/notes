### Bharat

Bharatiya culture but less conservative than status quo.

Historically important cities built with Bharatiya architecture,
but still matching today’s standard for infrastructure.

Bharatiya governance, legal, medical, engineering systems.

### India

A mix of world’s cultures.

Foreign influenced cities with infrastructure matching standards
of the west, the east and the middle east.

International governance, legal, medical, engineering systems.

### Miscellaneous

Individual cities would have the choice to align with either Bharat or India.
But it’s likely that they will either end up aligning with a regional power,
or become an amalgamation of Bharat and India.

There have been other empires and governments over the history of
subcontinent, such as Hindustan, and if people wish to align with them and
not with India or Bharat, then that’s perfectly fine as well.
