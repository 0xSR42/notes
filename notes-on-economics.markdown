Socialist economies are more peaceful, as they cater to needs of more people.
But crony socialism can creep into institutions, corrupting them in the
process. A universal basic income, or state sponsored basic needs such as
food, water, shelter and clothing; would be needed for a socialist economy.

Free market capitalism rewards hard work and smart work alike, but malevolent
actors can cheat to their advantage.

Real world economies are more likely to be mixed economies. USA and Indian
economies are described as market economies, whereas Germany and China try to
combine socialism and capitalism differently in their respective economies.

Public companies can be seen as governance models as they share many problems
with a government, such as those of governance, diversity, economics and
culture. Therefore, the sister governance notes can be useful in corporate
settings as well. ([Notes on Governance](notes-on-governance))

Startups can be seen as instruments of change in real world, by solving real
world problems. Furthermore, once a problem has been identified, startups allow
rapid generation of new jobs in economy for skilled and unskilled labour, by
breaking the larger problem into smaller pieces which individuals or teams can
solve.

Enterprises can also be seen as empires, and therefore are subject to internal
and external conflict. One way to grow a startup rapidly, would be to wage an
economic war on your competitiors. But one has to be careful, for corporate
conflict can escalate into geopolitical conflict, in case of multinational
corporations.

A startup's or a company's valuation and other financials are decided by market
factors such as market size, investor interest, and customers' willingness to
pay; and not necessarily by the novelty of the problem chosen or the solution
being offered.

The problems of governance, diversity, economics and culture can also be tied
to a currency. In times of conflict and mistrust, digital and cryptocurrencies
can allow preserving different cultures, by reducing their dependence on a
centrally managed currency which is subject to notorius authoritarianism.

Capital plays an important role in building or breaking culture. One can
choose to build an economy of knowledge workers, and not one of sex workers.

Going Dutch is one reasonable way to decide division of cost of any given
activity. ([Going Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch))

Hedging is an idea which comes useful outside of trading world as well. You
can spend your money on products or services which counter each other's use
case, therefore reducing your risk on either.
